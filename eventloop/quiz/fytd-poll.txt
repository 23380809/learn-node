- In eventloop/poll.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

The order of execution would be:
foo
done
Read Error

The whole thing would run synchronously. Since fs.readFile is a file IO operation (Async operaiton)
It would go to the poll phase of the event loop.
