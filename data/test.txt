The poll phase is actually a blocking phase. If the callback queue associated with it is empty, it blocks the event loop till the earliest scheduled callback in the timers queue. For example, consider an example where a callback is scheduled to run in 20 ms (using timeout). Also, letâ€™s say the script is reading asynchronously from a file which takes 15 ms. Since the read is asynchronous there is a callback which runs in 10 ms when the read is finished. In this case, the event loop will be blocked in the poll phase after the read is finished in 15 ms, waiting for the poll queue to be filled with I/O callbacks. It waits because the earliest timer callback is not until 20 ms. Once the queue is filled with the callback, it instantly runs the callback. At this point, the queue is empty and more than 20 ms have passed. So, the event loop zips back to the timers phase and runs the callback in its queue.
